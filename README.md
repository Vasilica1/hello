# hello
Practice git
git clone-> take a repository and download to my computer
git add -> add a file to track the next time I make a commit
git commit -m "message"-> save a snapshot of the currrent state of the repository
git status -> what's currently happening inside of my repository
git push -> pushed my changes to GitHub server
git commit -am "message" -> git commit and git add together
git pull-> the opposite what git push did, take the changes the currently exist on GitHub and go ahead and pull the most recent changes down
git log -> keep track all the changes the you have been made
git reset -> go to a latest version of the code
git reset --hard <commit> -> reset everything 
git reset --hard origin/master -> version of my repository that is currently on my GitHub
Merge Conflicts
Branching - working on different parts of the repository at the same time

git branch -> what branch I'm currently on and what branch exist in my repository
git checkout -b <newbranchname> -> create a new branch
git checkout <branchname> -> switch to an branch that already exists
git merge <branchname> -> take what is on the style branch (in our case) and merge to the main branch

add a new line
