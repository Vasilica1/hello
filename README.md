# hello
Practice git
git clone-> take a repository and download to my computer
git add -> add a file to track the next time I make a commit
git commit -m "message"-> save a snapshot of the currrent state of the repository
git status -> what's currently happening inside of my repository
git push -> pushed my changes to GitHub server
git commit -am "message" -> git commit and git add together
git pull-> the opposite what git push did, take the changes the currently exist on GitHub and go ahead and pull the most recent changes down
